# tess-two

A fork of Tesseract Tools for Android 
([tesseract-android-tools][tesseract-android-tools]) that adds some
additional functions. Tesseract Tools for Android is a set of Android APIs and
build files for the [Tesseract OCR][tesseract-ocr] and [Leptonica][leptonica] 
image processing libraries.

This project works with Tesseract 3.05.00dev, Leptonica 1.73, libjpeg 9b, and
libpng 1.6.20. The source code for these dependencies is included within the
`tess-two/jni` folder. 

The `tess-two` module contains tools for compiling the Tesseract and Leptonica
libraries for use on the Android platform. It provides a Java API for accessing 
natively-compiled Tesseract and Leptonica APIs.

The `eyes-two` module contains additional image processing code copied from the
[eyes-free project][eyes-free]. It includes native functions for text detection,
blur detection, optical flow detection, and thresholding. Eyes-two is not needed
for using the Tesseract or Leptonica APIs.

The `tess-two-test` module contains instrumented unit tests for tess-two.

## Pre-requisites

* Android 2.3 or higher
* A v3.02+ [trained data file][tessdata] for a language. Data files must be 
extracted to the Android device in a subdirectory named `tessdata`.

## Usage

To use tess-two from your app, edit your app module's `build.gradle` file to add 
tess-two as an external dependency:

	dependencies {
	    compile 'com.rmtheis:tess-two:6.0.3'
	}
	
[Javadoc][javadoc] is available.

## Building

If you want to modify the tess-two code, or you want to use the eyes-two module,
you may build the project yourself locally. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).


## Versions

Release points are tagged with [version numbers][semantic-versioning]. A change 
to the major version number indicates an API change making that version 
incompatible with previous versions.
